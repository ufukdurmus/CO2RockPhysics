# CO2RockPhysics
All the data used for this research is open-access and publicly available. Core measurements can be found on https://doi.org/10.11582/2023.00113 and well logs can be accessible on https://data.equinor.com.
RUN_FINAL_paper_figures is a script to reproduce the figures of the manuscript 
"Durmus, U., 2025, Rock physics modeling of sandstone reservoir and anisotropic cap rock for CO2 storage in Northern Lights, offshore Norway. JGR: Solid Earth (under review)"
The well log data needed for this research is also added within the directory. For the entire data, please refer to the link.
Research outputs are provided in MAT files except that rock mechanics data should be downloaded separetely and rock_mechnaics_data_v2 script should be run to reproduce analysis and necessary output for the figures.
All the subscripts must be in the same directory to run the main scripts.
MATLAB version R2024a is used for this research.
